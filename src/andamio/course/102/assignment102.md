In this module, we investigated a few ways that you can start to participate in the Andamio Network. You can [read the documentation](), [join the Andamio Discord server](), or [comment on the Andamio Whitepaper]().

The best way to learn about and participate in Andamio is to complete this course. You can bookmark the public calendar to see ways to get more involved.

At the end of this course, you'll earn a Contributor Token that allows you to start contributing directly to Andamio.

## Assignment + Evidence
For now, it's time to complete your second Assignment.
